The story follows Mr. Botibol, a passenger on a cruise ship who wants to win the pool, a betting game based on the captain's estimate of the distance the ship will travel in 24 hours. Mr. Botibol bids on a low number, hoping that bad weather will slow down the ship. However, when he sees that the weather is clear and calm, he devises a desperate plan to make the ship stop: he decides to jump overboard and pretend to be drowning, hoping that someone will notice him and alert the crew. He pays a woman to watch him from the deck and promise to raise the alarm when he falls into the water.
 
However, things go horribly wrong for Mr. Botibol. The woman turns out to be deaf and mute, and does not understand his instructions. She also has a heart attack and dies shortly after he jumps. Mr. Botibol is left alone in the ocean, watching helplessly as the ship sails away without him. He realizes that he has made a fatal mistake and that no one will ever find him.
 
Dip in the Pool is a darkly humorous story that showcases Dahl's skill at creating suspense and irony. It also explores themes such as greed, risk, fate, and human folly. The story has been adapted for television twice: once for Alfred Hitchcock Presents in 1958, starring Keenan Wynn as Mr. Botibol; and once for Tales of the Unexpected in 1980, starring Jack Weston as Mr. Botibol.[^3^]

## Plot Summary
 
The story begins with Mr. Botibol attending the auction for the pool on the second night of his cruise. He learns that the captain has estimated that the ship will travel 570 nautical miles in 24 hours. He decides to bid on a low number, 501, hoping that a storm will slow down the ship and make his number closer to the actual distance. He pays $800 for his ticket, which is more than he can afford.
 
The next morning, he wakes up to find that the weather is clear and sunny, and that the ship is moving fast. He realizes that he has no chance of winning the pool unless he can somehow make the ship stop or turn back. He comes up with a plan to jump overboard and pretend to be drowning, hoping that someone will see him and alert the crew. He thinks that this will cause the ship to stop for at least an hour, which will reduce the distance it will travel.
 
He goes to the deck and looks for someone who can help him with his plan. He spots a woman sitting alone on a deck chair, reading a book. He approaches her and offers her $100 to watch him from the deck and raise the alarm when he falls into the water. He tells her that he is doing this as a prank on his wife, who is sleeping in their cabin. He does not notice that the woman is wearing a hearing aid and does not hear him clearly. She nods and smiles, thinking that he is just making friendly conversation.
 
Mr. Botibol then goes to the stern of the ship and waits for an opportunity to jump. He sees a large wave coming and leaps over the railing, landing in the water with a splash. He expects to hear a scream or a shout from the woman, but there is only silence. He looks up and sees that she is still sitting on her chair, holding her chest and gasping for air. She has had a heart attack and dies shortly after.
 
Mr. Botibol realizes that he has made a terrible mistake and that no one has seen him jump. He tries to swim after the ship, but it is too fast and too far away. He starts to panic and scream for help, but no one hears him. He watches helplessly as the ship disappears over the horizon, leaving him alone in the ocean.
 
The story ends with Mr. Botibol thinking about his wife, who will wake up soon and wonder where he is. He also thinks about his ticket for 501, which is still in his pocket. He wonders if he will win the pool after all.
