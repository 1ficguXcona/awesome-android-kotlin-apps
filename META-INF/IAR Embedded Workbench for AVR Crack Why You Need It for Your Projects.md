- **User-friendly IDE:** The IDE provides project management tools, editor, linker and library tools, example projects and code templates for AVR. It also supports syntax highlighting, code completion, code folding, code navigation, refactoring, and more.
- **Powerful build tools:** The IAR C/C++ Compiler is a highly optimizing compiler for AVR. It offers configuration files for all AVR Classic, ATmega and FPSLIC families, including devices with the enhanced cores, relocating AVR assembler and run-time libraries. It also supports the C18 and C++17 language standards and additional GNU C language extensions[^1^].
- **Comprehensive debugger:** The C-SPY Debugger provides a AVR simulator, support for RTOS-aware debugging on hardware and extensive hardware debugger support. It also supports breakpoints, watchpoints, expressions, variables, registers, memory, call stack, disassembly, trace, profiling, code coverage, and more.
- **Integrated code analysis:** IAR Embedded Workbench for AVR provides integrated static code analysis through the add-on product C-STAT, ensuring code quality as well as proving alignment with standards such as MISRA C:2012. It also supports code metrics, data flow analysis, stack usage analysis, runtime error detection, and more.
- **On-demand training included:** When you buy a license of IAR Embedded Workbench for AVR, you get access to free training courses through our IAR Academy on Demand offering. You can learn at your own pace and get certified on topics such as C programming, debugging techniques, code optimization, and more.

## Benefits of using IAR Embedded Workbench for AVR
