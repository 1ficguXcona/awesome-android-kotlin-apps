But what is the history behind the C&O Hinton Division? How did it become one of the most important coal routes in the US? Let's take a look at some of the key events and facts that shaped this fascinating railroad.

- The C&O Hinton Division traces its origin to the Virginia Central Railroad, which was chartered in 1836 to connect Richmond with the Shenandoah Valley and beyond.
- The Virginia Central faced many challenges in crossing the Appalachian Mountains, and had to rely on state subsidies and engineering feats to overcome them. One of the most notable achievements was the Blue Ridge Tunnel, completed in 1858, which was then one of the longest tunnels in the world.
- The Virginia Central reached Jackson's River Station (later Clifton Forge) in 1856, but its westward expansion was halted by the Civil War, which devastated its tracks and finances.
- After the war, the Virginia Central was revived by Collis P. Huntington, a railroad tycoon who also built the Central Pacific and Southern Pacific railroads. Huntington merged the Virginia Central with the Covington & Ohio Railroad, which had been chartered in 1853 to build from Clifton Forge to the Ohio River.
- The merged company was renamed Chesapeake & Ohio Railway in 1869, and completed its main line from Richmond to Huntington, WV in 1873. This opened up a vast territory of coal fields along the New River and Kanawha River valleys.
- The C&O expanded its network by acquiring or building several branch lines and subsidiaries, such as the Greenbrier Railway, the Nicholas, Fayette & Greenbrier Railway, and the Loup Creek & Deepwater Railway. These lines served various coal mines and towns in West Virginia.
- The C&O also extended its reach to other major markets by building or acquiring lines to Cincinnati, OH (1888), Chicago, IL (1910), Newport News, VA (1881), and Washington, DC (1890).
- The C&O Hinton Division was named after Hinton, WV, which became a major division point and yard for the railroad. Hinton was also a hub for passenger service, with trains such as The George Washington, The Fast Flying Virginian, and The Sportsman stopping there.
- The C&O Hinton Division reached its peak of operations in the mid-20th century, when it hauled millions of tons of coal annually, as well as other freight and passengers. It also employed thousands of people and supported many communities along its tracks.
- The C&O Hinton Division faced many challenges in the latter half of the 20th century, such as competition from other modes of transportation, environmental regulations, labor disputes, and declining coal demand. It also underwent several mergers and reorganizations, becoming part of CSX Transportation in 1987.

Today, the C&O Hinton Division is still an active and vital part of the US rail system, carrying freight trains for CSX and Amtrak's Cardinal passenger train. It is also a popular destination for railfans and historians who want to experience the beauty and heritage of this legendary railroad.
