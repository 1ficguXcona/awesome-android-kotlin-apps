## Getting Started with Autograph 3.3.10
 
To use Autograph 3.3.10, you need to download and install it from the official website[^2^]. The software is compatible with Windows operating systems and requires a minimum of 177.8 MB of disk space[^1^]. Once you have installed Autograph 3.3.10, you can launch it from your desktop or start menu.
 
When you open Autograph 3.3.10, you will see a blank white screen with a toolbar at the top and a status bar at the bottom. The toolbar contains icons for different modes and tools that you can use to create and edit graphs. The status bar shows information about the current graph, such as the coordinates of the cursor, the equation of the function, and the scale of the axes.
 
## Creating a 2D Graph in Autograph 3.3.10
 
To create a 2D graph in Autograph 3.3.10, you need to select the 2D mode from the toolbar or press F2 on your keyboard. This will change the screen to a Cartesian coordinate system with x- and y-axes.
 
Next, you need to enter the equation of the function that you want to graph. You can do this by clicking on the equation icon on the toolbar or pressing F4 on your keyboard. This will open a dialog box where you can type in your equation using standard mathematical notation. For example, if you want to graph y = x^2 + 2x - 3, you can type it as y=x^2+2x-3.
 
After entering your equation, click OK or press Enter on your keyboard. This will plot the graph of your function on the screen. You can adjust the appearance of your graph by changing its color, thickness, style, or transparency using the options on the toolbar.
 
## Creating a 3D Graph in Autograph 3.3.10
 
To create a 3D graph in Autograph 3.3.10, you need to select the 3D mode from the toolbar or press F3 on your keyboard. This will change the screen to a three-dimensional coordinate system with x-, y-, and z-axes.
 
Next, you need to enter the equation of the function that you want to graph. You can do this by clicking on the equation icon on the toolbar or pressing F4 on your keyboard. This will open a dialog box where you can type in your equation using standard mathematical notation. For example, if you want to graph z = x^2 + y^2, you can type it as z=x^2+y^2.
